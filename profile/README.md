# Nyx

This group contains an overview of the Nyx project. The Nyx project consists of its core component, a modified version of QEMU that allows to take and reset VM snapshots thousands of times per second, a modified version of KVM to enabled nested fuzzing and Intel-PT tracing during fuzzing, as well as some auxilary tools such as Spec-Fuzzer, a fuzzer specificially designed for fuzzing complex interactive targets. Spec-Fuzzer is capable of fuzzing anything that runs inside of KVM. This includes applications, kernels and even hypervisors - Nyx can be used to easily build fuzzers for almost anything.

## Repositories

Nyx framework consists in total of the following modules. 

#### Core
- [libnyx](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/libnyx) - a library that you can readily use to run, snapshot and restore VMs to build your own fuzzers.
- [packer](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/packer) - a tool that allows to bundle and pack targets into the type of VM we mostly use for ring-3 fuzzing.
- [QEMU-Nyx](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/QEMU-Nyx) - a modified version of QEMU that allows to take and restore snapshot, as well as communication via shared memory and hypercalls.
- [KVM-Nyx](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/KVM-Nyx) - a modified version of KVM that enables Nyx's ability to use Intel-PT.
- [libxdc](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/libxdc) - the fastest Intel-PT decoder in the west. Used to get coverage information from binary targets.

#### Fuzzer-Frontends

- [Spec-Fuzzer](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/spec-fuzzer) - An example fuzzer that allows to fuzz targets with highly interactive inputs such as syscalls, hypercalls, API calls, GUI interations or -of course - network applications.
- [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/tree/stable/nyx_mode) - Nyx integration has just landed in AFL++. It is implemented by using libnyx to enable fast snapshot-based fuzzing of arbitrary x86/x86-64 code running in QEMU-Nyx. It supports almost all features provided by Nyx (with the exception of REDQUEEN and some other more advanced features). If you want to fuzz userland targets, in-process file parsers, kernel interfaces or something else, you should definitely check it out. 

You can find an incomplete documentation and some tutorials [here](https://github.com/nyx-fuzz/Nyx/tree/main/docs). Or check out the [Nyx mode documentation](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus/blob/stable/nyx_mode/README.md) in the AFL++ repository.
